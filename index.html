                <p>For over a thousand years, humankind has been perfecting the art of making and drinking coffee. From the first goar herder who is said to have begun dancing with his animals after eating the mysterious red berry, 
                to the modern-day commuter svoring a wake-up cup of java, the magical coffee bean has become both an addictive necessity and welcome threat.</p>
