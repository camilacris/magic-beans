                <h3>The History of Coffee</h3>
                <p>Coffee traces its biological herritage to a genus of plants known as Coffee.<br>
                    Everyone reconizes a roasted coffee bean but unless you have lived or traveled in a coffee growing country, you might not recognize an actual coffee tree.<br>
                    Prunes short in cultivation, but capable of growing more than 30 feet high, a coffee tree is covered with dark-green, waxy leaves growing opposite each other in pairs.</p>

                    <h3>A Brief Timeline and History of Coffee</h3>
                    <br>
                        <p><b>1850 CE:</b>
                        The coffee bean is discovered by an Ethiopian herdsman who observed his goats acting in a strange manner after eating red berries from a coffee bush. Legend says that the herdsman showed the beans to local monks, who thought they were from the devil and, in turn, threw them into a fire. This resulted in the pleasant aroma of fresh-roasted coffee, which then prompted them to find a way to consume it. Somewhere along the way, they figured out they could chop it up and mix it with water to make a delicious and energizing beverage!
                        </p>
                        <p><b>1000:</b>
                        The first known piece of literature describing coffee by philosopher Avicenna Bukhara is recorded.
                       
                        <p><b>1454:</b>
                        The first coffee houses, which double as spaces for religious practices, are established in Ethiopia, called Kaveh Kanes.
                        
                        <p><b>1511:</b>
                        In Mecca, citizens gather in coffee houses to discuss political issues. The governor, fearful of the influence these gatherings produce, bans coffee and has the coffee houses shut down.
                        
                        <p><b>1570:</b>
                        Coffee arrives in Venice, which then facilitates the spread of coffee across the world.
    
                        <p><b>1800 S:</b>
                        Global coffee consumption skyrockets with the growth of companies such as Folgers and Maxwell House.
                       
                        <p><b>1884:</b>
                        Angelo Moriondo receives the patent for the first espresso machine.

                        <p><b>1908:</b>
                        Melitta Bentz patents the coffee filter.

                        <p><b>1971:</b>
                        Starbucks opens its first store in Seattle and helps initiate the “second wave” of coffee, focused on increasing the quality of the coffee.

                        <p><b>1982:</b>
                        The Specialty Coffee Association is formed to help foster and support innovation within the high-quality coffee market.
                       
                        <p><b>2002:</b>
                        The term “third wave” is coined by Trish Rothgeb of Wrecking Ball Roasters, who compares specialty coffee workers to artisans due to the level of care they devote to the product throughout the entire coffee-making process— from crop to cup.
                    
                        <p><b>Present Day:</b>
                        We see a growing interest in specialty coffee and practices to help shape the trajectory of coffee in the future!
